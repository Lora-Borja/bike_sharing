# bike_sharing

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to visualize the analysis of bike-sharing data in NY City during the peak season of August 2019, in order to provide insight on whether this business will be a success in Des Moines. The total number of riders in the dataset was 2,344,224. Using Tableau, we were able to create worksheets, dashboards, and a story to present the findings. Below is a link to my published work on Tableau Public site.

* There are 588,431 Female riders - which makes up 25%, while the remaining unknown are 10%.
* 81% of the customer type are subscribers, while the rest are one-time customers!
* Almost 240K riders are age 50 - born in 1970!
* We can also see that majority of riders are born from 1980 to 2000 - which means we have an attractive age demographic of adults 19-39!

Page 2 - Peak Times & Locations
* The most popular start and end locations suggests there are many riders from tourist spots throughout the city centre area.
* There are two peak riding hours: 1) between 8am to 10am; 2) between 5pm to 7pm.
* The peak hours also suggests that our riders may be using the bike-sharing service as a means of transportation to and from work.
* Bike maintenance and repairs should be made at the least busy hours, which is around 12am to 6am.

* The top graph are checkout times for all users, and it seems that between the peak hours of 8am to 10am the average trip duration ranges from 16-51 minutes.
* The bottom graph shows the same curve based on all day trip duration and that majority of the rider population are Males!

Page 4 - A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, as well as by user type and gender
* The trips by weekday by hour confirms the peak hours as seen in page 2 dashboard.
* It is safe to say that the highest demand for bike-sharing is at times most people commute to and from work!
* We can also see that there's demand on the weekends between 10a to 8pm.
* The trips by user type and gender confirms the subscribers and males make up majority of the ride count.
